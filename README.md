# DSA210-Project


**Project Idea**

The idea of my project is to focus on analyzing the performance and engagement metrics of my TikTok account (@studylabaii) that I manage as part of a social media marketing campaign. By studying content trends, audience behavior, and engagement patterns, the project aims to provide more insights to improve marketing strategies and maximize the account's reach.

Null Hypothesis: The day of the week has no significant effect on video performance metrics (views, likes, shares, comments)

Alternate Hypothesis: The day of the week has a significant effect on video performance metrics
